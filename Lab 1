CS 2430 - Lab 1 - To Get you started on Program 1  

For this lab, you will be starting Program 1.  

1. On your J drive, make a Prog1 folder.   

2. Follow the directions as in the Program 0 description to make  project 
   and add Prog1.java to it by copying it into the src folder. 

3. The next 2 steps help you to create two files:
       TableTennisPlayer.java and TabletennisPlayerDatabase.java

4. Start the class for TableTennisPlayerDatabase.java.  Use File/New File to create it.
   Select Java for Cagegory and Java Class for File type.
   Click Next button and for Class Name type in:    TableTennisPlayerDatabase

   Copy and paste the following into your class.  
   Make sure to NOT have 2 lines of "public class TableTennisPlayerDatabase"
   and correct number of matching curly braces.

import java.util.Scanner;
public class TableTennisPlayerDatabase
{
       
   public void run()
   {
      System.out.println("In the run method");
   }
}

This is a "STUB" for the run method.  Later, we will use the run method as 
a "DRIVER" to test methods in TableTennisPlayer.java.  Save, then add this file 
to your project.  

Build & run Prog1.  
                                             
5. Start the class for TableTennisPlayer.java as done in the step above.


public class TableTennisPlayer
{
   private String name;   // name of the TableTennisPlayer
   private int rating;    // rating of TableTennisPlayer
   private int adjustmentForTournament;

   // initialize TableTennisPlayerName and TTrating
   // Don't forget to set adjustmentForTournament to 0
   public TableTennisPlayer ( String TableTennisPlayerName, int TTrating  )
   {







   }

}

Build and run.  

6. Adding in methods one at a time.  Do the toString method first.
      a. Add a toString method to TableTennisPlayer (see Prog1 description &
         see the notes.)
      b. Add the following code to the TableTennisPlayerDatabase run method:
         TableTennisPlayer TTplayer =
                               new TableTennisPlayer( "Scanman", 1350 );
         System.out.println(TTplayer);      
      c. Compile until all errors are gone, then RUN it.

7. Add in the other 2 methods one at a time, as in 6 above. See the
Program 1 description for hints as to what the code does.
For each method you write, add a call in the TableTennisPlayerDatabase run method 
to call the method and write the results (a simple TEST of the method).  
Then compile, run to see that each one works.
